## 🚀 Quick Start

### Web Export (5 Minutes)

1. **Register your game** at [cheddaboards.com](https://cheddaboards.com)
2. **Copy files** to your project:
   - `addons/cheddaboards/` folder
   - `template.html` to project root
3. **Run Setup Wizard**: File → Run → `SetupWizard.gd`
4. **Configure export**: Project → Export → Web → Custom HTML Shell: `res://template.html`
5. **Export as `index.html`** and test with local server

### Native Export (Windows/Mac/Linux/Mobile)

1. **Register your game** at [cheddaboards.com](https://cheddaboards.com)
2. **Get your API Key** from the dashboard
3. **Copy files** to your project:
   - `addons/cheddaboards/` folder
4. **Add Autoloads** in Project Settings:
   - `CheddaBoards` → `addons/cheddaboards/CheddaBoards.gd`
   - `Achievements` → `addons/cheddaboards/Achievements.gd`
5. **Set API key** in CheddaBoards.gd or at runtime:
   ```gdscript

## 🔧 Platform Modes

### Hybrid Architecture

The SDK automatically detects the platform and uses the appropriate backend:

| Platform | Mode | Authentication Options |
|----------|------|----------------------|
| Web | JavaScript Bridge | Chedda ID ✅, Anonymous ✅, Google/Apple ⚙️ |
| Windows/Mac/Linux | HTTP API | Anonymous ✅ |
| Mobile | HTTP API | Anonymous ✅ |

> ✅ = Works out of box | ⚙️ = Requires your own OAuth credentials

```gdscript
# The SDK handles this automatically!
# Same code works on all platforms:

func _ready():
    await CheddaBoards.wait_until_ready()
    
    # This works on web AND native:
    CheddaBoards.login_anonymous("PlayerName")
    CheddaBoards.submit_score(1000, 5)
```

### Anonymous Play (Recommended for Native)

Anonymous play uses device IDs - no account creation required:

```gdscript
func _ready():
    await CheddaBoards.wait_until_ready()
    
    # Login with device ID + custom nickname
    CheddaBoards.login_anonymous("CheeseMaster")
    
    # Or setup without emitting signals (for pre-config)
    CheddaBoards.setup_anonymous_player("", "CheeseMaster")

func _on_game_over(score: int, streak: int):
    # Works exactly like authenticated play
    CheddaBoards.submit_score(score, streak)
```

**Benefits of Anonymous Play:**
- ✅ Instant play - no login popups
- ✅ Works on ALL platforms (web + native)
- ✅ Players can set custom nicknames
- ✅ Scores appear on leaderboards
- ✅ Achievements still work
- ✅ Device ID persists across sessions

---

## 🎯 Integration Guide

### Basic Setup

```gdscript
extends Node

func _ready():
    # Wait for SDK
    await CheddaBoards.wait_until_ready()
    
    # Connect signals
    CheddaBoards.login_success.connect(_on_login)
    CheddaBoards.score_submitted.connect(_on_score_saved)
    CheddaBoards.score_error.connect(_on_score_error)

func _start_game():
    # For anonymous play (works everywhere)
    CheddaBoards.login_anonymous("PlayerName")

func _on_login(nickname: String):
    print("Welcome, ", nickname)
    # Start your game...

func _on_game_over(score: int, streak: int):
    # Submit score (with achievements if using Achievements.gd)
    if Achievements:
        Achievements.increment_games_played()
        Achievements.check_game_over(score, 0, streak)
        Achievements.submit_with_score(score, streak)
    else:
        CheddaBoards.submit_score(score, streak)

func _on_score_saved(score: int, streak: int):
    print("Score saved: ", score)

func _on_score_error(reason: String):
    print("Error: ", reason)
```

### Authentication Options

```gdscript
# === ANONYMOUS (Web + Native) - Works out of box! ===
CheddaBoards.login_anonymous("CustomNickname")

# === CHEDDA ID (Web) - Works out of box! ===
CheddaBoards.login_internet_identity("Nickname")

# === GOOGLE/APPLE (Web) - Requires your own OAuth credentials ===
# Set GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID or APPLE_SERVICE_ID in template.html first
CheddaBoards.login_google()
CheddaBoards.login_apple()

# === Check Status ===
if CheddaBoards.is_authenticated():
    print("Logged in as: ", CheddaBoards.get_nickname())
    
if CheddaBoards.is_anonymous():
    print("Playing anonymously")
    
if CheddaBoards.has_account():
    print("Has real account (Google/Apple/Chedda ID)")

# === Logout ===
CheddaBoards.logout()
```

### Scores & Leaderboards

```gdscript
# Submit score
CheddaBoards.submit_score(1000, 25)  # score, streak

# Get leaderboard
CheddaBoards.leaderboard_loaded.connect(_on_leaderboard)
CheddaBoards.get_leaderboard("score", 100)  # sort_by, limit

func _on_leaderboard(entries: Array):
    for entry in entries:
        print("%d. %s - %d pts" % [entry.rank, entry.nickname, entry.score])

# Get player rank
CheddaBoards.player_rank_loaded.connect(_on_rank)
CheddaBoards.get_player_rank("score")

func _on_rank(rank: int, score: int, streak: int, total: int):
    print("You are #%d of %d players!" % [rank, total])
```

### Nickname Management

```gdscript
# Get current nickname
var name = CheddaBoards.get_nickname()

# Set nickname (anonymous players)
CheddaBoards.set_nickname("NewName")

# Change nickname via API (persists to backend)
CheddaBoards.change_nickname_to("NewName")
CheddaBoards.nickname_changed.connect(func(n): print("Now known as: ", n))
CheddaBoards.nickname_error.connect(func(e): print("Error: ", e))

# Web only - opens popup
CheddaBoards.change_nickname()
```

### Achievements

```gdscript
# Check if Achievements autoload exists
var has_achievements = get_node_or_null("/root/Achievements") != null

# Unlock single achievement
Achievements.unlock("first_game")

# Check achievements during gameplay
Achievements.check_score(current_score)
Achievements.check_combo(max_combo)
Achievements.check_clicks(total_clicks)

# At game over - check all + increment games
Achievements.increment_games_played()
Achievements.check_game_over(score, clicks, max_combo)

# Submit score WITH achievements attached
Achievements.submit_with_score(score, streak)

# Query status
var unlocked = Achievements.get_unlocked_count()
var total = Achievements.get_total_count()
var percent = Achievements.get_unlocked_percentage()
print("%d/%d (%.0f%%)" % [unlocked, total, percent])
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### API Key (Native/Anonymous)

Set in CheddaBoards.gd:
```gdscript
var api_key: String = "cb_your_api_key_here"
```

Or at runtime:
```gdscript
func _ready():
    CheddaBoards.set_api_key("cb_your_api_key_here")
```

### HTML Template (Web)

In `template.html`:
```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    GAME_ID: 'your-game-id',  // From dashboard
    CANISTER_ID: 'fdvph-sqaaa-aaaap-qqc4a-cai',
    
    // Optional: Social login
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID: '',
    APPLE_SERVICE_ID: '',
    APPLE_REDIRECT_URI: ''
};
```

### Project Settings

For high-DPI display support:
- Display → Window → DPI → Allow Hidpi: `On`
- Display → Window → Stretch → Mode: `canvas_items`
- Display → Window → Stretch → Aspect: `keep`

## 🐛 Debugging

### Debug Methods

```gdscript
# Print full status
CheddaBoards.debug_status()
Achievements.debug_status()

# Enable verbose logging
CheddaBoards.debug_logging = true
Achievements.debug_logging = true
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts (add to your game)

```gdscript
func _input(event):
    if event is InputEventKey and event.pressed:
        if event.keycode == KEY_F9:
            CheddaBoards.debug_status()
        if event.keycode == KEY_F10:
            Achievements.debug_status()
```

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "API key not set" | Set `api_key` in CheddaBoards.gd or call `set_api_key()` |
| "CheddaBoards not ready" | Use `await CheddaBoards.wait_until_ready()` |
| Score not submitting | Check `is_authenticated()` and connect to `score_error` |
| Click offset on high-DPI | Enable "Allow Hidpi" in Project Settings |
| Web: "Engine not defined" | Export must be named `index.html` |
| Web: Blank screen | Use local server, not `file://` |
