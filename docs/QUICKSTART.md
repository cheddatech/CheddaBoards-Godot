## Choose Your Integration

| Path | Time | Best For |
|------|------|----------|
| **[API Only](#-api-quick-start)** | 3 min | Native builds, simple integration |
| **[Full Web SDK](#-web-sdk-quick-start)** | 5 min | Web builds with login UI, OAuth |

> 💡 **Not sure?** Start with API Only - it works everywhere and you can add web features later.

# 🚀 API Quick Start

**The simplest integration. Works on all platforms.**

### Step 1: Get API Key (2 min)

1. Go to [cheddaboards.com/dashboard](https://cheddaboards.com/dashboard)
2. Sign in (Internet Identity, Google, or Apple)
3. Register your game → Copy your **Game ID**
4. Click **"Generate API Key"**
5. Copy your key: `cb_your-game_xxxxxxxxx`

### Step 2: Add to Project (30 sec)

Download from [GitHub](https://github.com/cheddatech/CheddaBoards-Godot) and copy `addons/cheddaboards/` folder to your project.

Add as Autoload:
```
Project → Project Settings → Autoload → Add
Path: res://addons/cheddaboards/CheddaBoards.gd
Name: CheddaBoards
```

Set your credentials in CheddaBoards.gd:
```gdscript
var game_id: String = "your-game-id"
var api_key: String = "cb_your-game_xxxxxxxxx"
```

> 💡 **Tip:** Run `File → Run → addons/cheddaboards/SetupWizard.gd` to configure automatically!

### Step 3: Use It (30 sec)

```gdscript
func _ready():
    await CheddaBoards.wait_until_ready()
    CheddaBoards.login_anonymous("PlayerName")

func _on_game_over(score, streak):
    CheddaBoards.submit_score(score, streak)

func _show_leaderboard():
    CheddaBoards.leaderboard_loaded.connect(_on_leaderboard)
    CheddaBoards.get_leaderboard("score", 100)

func _on_leaderboard(entries):
    for e in entries:
        print("#%d %s - %d" % [e.rank, e.nickname, e.score])
```

### ✅ Done!

**Total time: ~3 minutes**

You now have global leaderboards, score submission, and player nicknames.

# 🌐 Web SDK Quick Start

**Full integration with login UI, Chedda ID, and optional Google/Apple OAuth.**

### Step 1: Register Game (2 min)

1. Go to [cheddaboards.com/dashboard](https://cheddaboards.com/dashboard)
2. Sign in and register your game
3. Copy your **Game ID**
4. (Optional) Generate API key for anonymous play

### Step 2: Download Files (1 min)

From [GitHub](https://github.com/cheddatech/CheddaBoards-Godot), copy to your project:

```
YourGame/
├── addons/
│   └── cheddaboards/
│       ├── CheddaBoards.gd
│       ├── Achievements.gd

└── template.html          ← Required for web!
```

### Step 3: Run Setup Wizard (30 sec)

```

```

The wizard (v2.4) will:
- ✅ Auto-add Autoloads

- ✅ Configure Google/Apple OAuth credentials (optional)

### Step 4: Configure Export (30 sec)

### Step 5: Export & Test (1 min)

1. Export as **`index.html`** (important!)
2. Run local server: `python3 -m http.server 8000`
3. Open `http://localhost:8000`
4. Test login and leaderboards!

### ✅ Done!

**Total time: ~5 minutes**

You now have:
- ✅ Chedda ID login (works out of box)
- ✅ Anonymous play
- ✅ Google/Apple login (requires your OAuth credentials)
- ✅ Achievements system
- ✅ Full leaderboard UI
