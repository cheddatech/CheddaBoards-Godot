## Quick Fixes

**90% of problems are solved by:**

| Problem Type | Fix |
|--------------|-----|
| API/Native issues | Check API key is set correctly |
| Web issues | Use web server (not file://), export as `index.html` |
| Both | Run Setup Wizard, check Autoloads |

---

## First: Run the Setup Wizard

Before debugging manually, run the wizard:

```
File → Run (Ctrl+Shift+X) → Select SetupWizard.gd
```

It auto-fixes:
- Missing Autoloads
- Wrong Game ID
- Export settings

## API Key Issues

### "API key not set"

**Cause:** Native builds require an API key.

**Fix:**
1. Go to [cheddaboards.com/dashboard](https://cheddaboards.com/dashboard)
2. Open your game → Generate API Key
3. Copy the key (looks like `cb_your-game_xxxxxxxxx`)
4. Set in CheddaBoards.gd:

```gdscript
var api_key: String = "cb_your-game_xxxxxxxxx"
```

### "Invalid API key"

**Cause:** Key doesn't match game or was revoked.

**Fix:**
1. Go to dashboard
2. Check the key matches your game
3. Generate a new key if needed

### "Request failed"

**Checklist:**
- [ ] API key is correct
- [ ] Internet connection works
- [ ] Game is registered and active

**Debug:**
```gdscript
CheddaBoards.debug_logging = true
CheddaBoards.request_failed.connect(func(endpoint, error):
    print("Failed: %s - %s" % [endpoint, error])
)
```

## Login Issues

### Which login works where?

| Method | Native | Mobile | Web |
|--------|--------|--------|-----|
| Anonymous | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Google (Device Code) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Apple (Device Code) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Google (Direct OAuth) | — | — | ✅ |
| Apple (Direct OAuth) | — | — | ✅ |
| Account Upgrade | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

### "Not authenticated"

**Cause:** Trying to submit score without logging in.

**Fix:**
```gdscript
func _ready():
    await CheddaBoards.wait_until_ready()
    CheddaBoards.login_anonymous("Player")  # Do this first!

func _on_game_over(score, streak):
    if CheddaBoards.is_authenticated():
        CheddaBoards.submit_score(score, streak)
    else:
        print("Not logged in!")
```

### Device code not appearing

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Connected to `device_code_received` signal
- [ ] Internet connection works
- [ ] API key is set

**Debug:**
```gdscript
CheddaBoards.device_code_received.connect(func(url, code, expires_in):
    print("Code: %s at %s (expires in %ds)" % [code, url, expires_in])
)

CheddaBoards.device_code_expired.connect(func():
    print("Device code expired")
)

CheddaBoards.login_failed.connect(func(reason):
    print("Login failed: ", reason)
)
```

### Device code expired before player could sign in

**Cause:** Codes expire after 5 minutes.

**Fix:** Call `login_google_device_code()` or `login_apple_device_code()` again to get a fresh code.

### Login button does nothing (Web)

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Using http://localhost, not file://
- [ ] Popups allowed in browser
- [ ] Game ID set in template.html

### Google/Apple direct OAuth not working (Web)

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Using http:// or https://, not file://
- [ ] Popups allowed in browser
- [ ] OAuth credentials configured in template.html
- [ ] Using latest template.html

---

## Score Issues

### Score not saving

**Checklist:**
- [ ] `is_authenticated()` returns true
- [ ] API key is set (native)
- [ ] No errors in console

**Debug:**
```gdscript
CheddaBoards.score_error.connect(func(reason):
    print("Score error: ", reason)
)

CheddaBoards.score_submitted.connect(func(score, streak):
    print("Saved: %d, %d" % [score, streak])
)
```

### Score saves but doesn't appear on leaderboard

**Causes:**
1. Score isn't higher than previous best
2. Network delay — wait a few seconds
3. Wrong Game ID

**Fix:** Submit a higher score, refresh leaderboard.

### "Score rejected" or anti-cheat error

**Cause:** Score exceeds game's anti-cheat limits.

**Fix:** Check your game's Security tab on the dashboard. Adjust limits based on your game's mechanics.

---

## Leaderboard Issues

### Leaderboard is empty

**Causes:**
1. No scores submitted yet
2. Wrong Game ID
3. Network error

**Fix:**
1. Submit a test score first
2. Run Setup Wizard to verify Game ID
3. Check console for errors

### Wrong data showing

**Cause:** Wrong Game ID — each game has its own leaderboard.

**Fix:** Verify Game ID in template.html or CheddaBoards.gd matches dashboard.

---

## Web Issues

### Blank screen / nothing loads

**Cause:** Opening HTML file directly (file://)

**Fix:** Use a web server:
```bash
cd your-export-folder
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Open http://localhost:8000
```

### "Engine is not defined"

**Cause:** Export not named `index.html`

**Fix:** Re-export and save as `index.html` (not MyGame.html)

### "CheddaBoards is not defined"

**Cause:** Custom HTML Shell not set.

**Fix:**
1. Project → Export → Web
2. HTML section → Custom HTML Shell: `res://template.html`
3. Re-export

### CORS error

**Cause:** Using file:// instead of http://

**Fix:** Use local web server (see blank screen fix above)

## Display Issues

### Clicks offset / wrong position

**Cause:** High-DPI display scaling (125%, 150%)

**Fix:**
1. Project → Project Settings
2. Display → Window → DPI
3. **Allow Hidpi:** `On`

### UI too small/large

**Fix:**
1. Display → Window → Stretch
2. **Mode:** `canvas_items`
3. **Aspect:** `keep`

---

## Achievement Issues

### Achievements not unlocking

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Achievements.gd in Autoloads
- [ ] Player is authenticated
- [ ] Calling the check methods

**Fix:**
```gdscript
Achievements.check_score(score)
Achievements.increment_games_played()
```

### Achievements not saving

**Cause:** Not syncing to backend.

**Fix:** Use `submit_with_score()`:
```gdscript
Achievements.submit_with_score(score, streak)
```

> **Note:** Full achievement sync requires login (Google/Apple). Anonymous users have achievements stored locally.

---

## Debug Tools

### Enable Logging

```gdscript
CheddaBoards.debug_logging = true
Achievements.debug_logging = true
```

### Print Status

```gdscript
CheddaBoards.debug_status()
Achievements.debug_status()
```

### Browser Console (Web)

1. Press F12
2. Console tab
3. Look for `[CheddaBoards]` messages

---
